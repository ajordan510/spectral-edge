# SpectralEdge

**SpectralEdge** is a professional-grade signal processing suite designed for engineers and scientists. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for interactive analysis, batch processing capabilities for large datasets, and a comprehensive library of signal processing functions.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform:** Compatible with both Linux and Windows.
- **Modular Design:** A library of core functions separate from the GUI, allowing for easy expansion and maintenance.
- **Advanced Plotting:** Interactive plots with features like zooming, panning, and data selection.
- **Report Generation:** Automatically generate reports in PowerPoint format with embedded plots.
- **Versatile Data Input:** Supports both CSV and HDF5 file formats.
- **High-Performance:** Optimized for handling high-rate data (5000+ samples per second) and large channel counts.
- **User-Friendly Distribution:** Packaged as a portable application that does not require admin privileges for installation.

## Epics

- **Epic 1: Foundation & Framework:** Establish the project structure, core libraries, testing framework, and initial GUI landing page.
- **Future Epics:** Focus on the development of individual signal processing tools and modules.

## Setup and Installation
